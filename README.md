### Welcome! I am Howard Pong Yuen LAM
#### I love to share ideas with short videos, and use examples to explain concepts step by step.
All videos are available in xiaohongshu 小红书 now. Most videos have my voice over in Putonghua and simplified Chinese sub-titles.
The videos cover the following topics.<br>
Python, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, OpenCV, Mathematics, Jupyter Notebook. 

The book, Marketing Research with R and Python, is available at Amazon now with Kindle version. There are two chapters with free access. Chapter 1 is about marketing: consumers, customers, company, competitors, collaborators, context; branding strategy. Chapter 2 is about marketing research or not: shampoo promotion example; chocolate bar upsize example.
