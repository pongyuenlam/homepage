### Welcome! I am Howard Pong Yuen LAM
#### I have high intellectual curiosity to learn and share ideas with short videos. I love using examples to explain concepts step by step.
All videos are available in xiaohongshu 小红书 now. Most videos have my voice over in Putonghua and simplified Chinese sub-titles.

The videos cover the following topics.
Python, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, OpenCV, Mathematics, Jupyter Notebook. 


The book, Marketing Research with R and Python, is available at Amazon now with Kindle version. There are two chapters with free access. Chapter 1 is about marketing: consumers, customers, company, competitors, collaborators, context; branding strategy. Chapter 2 is about marketing research or not: shampoo promotion example; chocolate bar upsize example. If you are using Kindle, you can easily refer to these two chapters by getting a free sample of this book.
